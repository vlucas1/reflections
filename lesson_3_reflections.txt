When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Always if work is worth pushing to remote.

***

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

To have full control.

***

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.
When would you use one instead of another?

Branches to work in my project. Forks to fork one's project on GitHub.
Clones to clone e.g. a forked project on to my local machine.

***

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known
state of the remote stored locally?

To be in sync with the work of others.
